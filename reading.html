    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p>I didn't read much as a kid, but started to read a lot more in college. I usually alternate between fiction and non-fiction.
        Often, I am eager to leave lab or skip hanging out with friends to finish the book I'm reading.
    </p>
        
    <p>My favorite fiction genre, when I can get through it, is 20th century modernist literature. James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> was incredible, although I only understood
        10% of it even with the help of a professor. As for non-fiction, I like to read popular science books, especially about the history of technology,
         but not often about biology because I do research in that field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, I'm reading the short story anthology <i>Writer's Choice</i> assembled by L. R. Hill. Each of about 20 American 
        authors chose their favorite story to include. I particularly liked Capote's "Children on Their Birthdays" and Yates' "A Really Good Jazz Piano."

        Below are some of my favorite books and quotes from them.
