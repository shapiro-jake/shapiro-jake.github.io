<h2>Flying</h2>
<p class="subheading">In Beverly, MA</p>

<p>
  I love flying.
  Whenever I board a plane, I make sure to peek through the narrow jetbridge windows to gaze at the giant, swirling engine; the best holiday gift I got as a kid was a bee-yellow Syma RC helicopter.
  Recently, I did an introductory flight at a local airport. I don't think I'll get my pilot's license soon (because of time + money) but I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the day.

<h2>Camp</h2>
<p class="subheading">In New Hampshire and in Israel</p>

<p>
  Growing up, I went to overnight Russian Jewish Math camp in New Hampshire for 12 years.
  In 2021, I was head counselor, which was one of the best experiences of my life.
  In addition to planning and executing activities for all the campers, I became friends with the staff.
  But these staff are no ordinary staff.
  Pretty much all of them are Soviet-Jewish immigrants; the cooks all have Masters degrees in math and CS; our band director is a professional Klezmer musician; and the camp director is the fouder of the Russian School of Mathematics.
  It was awesome to be at right at the intersection of two unique generations.
</p>

<p>
  We also have a sister camp in Israel for the children of Sderot, a town just a few miles from the Gaza border and which is under frequent rocketfire.
  Every year, a cohort of counselors from my overnight camp puts on a 2-week camp in central Israel, away from the rockets, for kids from Sderot.
  This was my first time in Israel, and it was an incredible and unique experience and introduction to the country.
