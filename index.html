<h1>Jake Shapiro</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Jake, a 3rd-year grad student in Fei Chen's Lab at the Broad.
  I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and have spent the past 6 years in Cambridge, MA. 
  I studied CS and Bio in undergrad and am now developing technologies to make new biological measurements.
  I like many things, especially things that are alive and things that fly.
  Feel free to check out my work at the links above!
