<h2>Every Second Counts</h2>>
<p class="subheading">From <i>The Bear</i></p>

<p>
  One of my favorite shows is <i>The Bear</i> in part because it's about food, drive, and Chicago - three great things in this world.
  When Richie is working at Alinea, there is this sign that gets a spotlight shot:

  The phrase "Every Second Counts" is complicated, but many parts of it resonated with me, so I wanted to make my own version.
  I CADed up a simple design and brought it to life at MIT's makerspaces.
  It's made from painted laser-cut plywood, with a blue acrylic front panel with an acetal film diffuser, and backlit by LEDs.
  Simple, but very happy with how it turned out.

<h2>Drones!</h2>
<p class="subheading">Building and flying</p>

<p>
  Over the past few years, I've built and flown a few drones.
  One of them was an FPV drone that I put together, and recently, I've been flying the BetaFPV Air75 TinyWhoop.

<h2>Word Game!</h2>
<p class="subheading">Small project in TypeScript</p>

<p>
  After learning TypeScript in my software engineering class, I make a simple word game.
  In this game, players are paired up with one another and guess words turn-by-turn until they match.
  The goal is to guess the same word as soon as possible. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/shapiro-jake/word-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code here</a> and a short demo video below.
